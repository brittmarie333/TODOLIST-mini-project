# 1. TODO List Mini Project

In this project I have created a program to manage a todo list. 

### What can I do with my list?

*add task*
*view task*
*mark complete*
*delete*
*quit*

### what are the expectations of this program?

Code must be able to perform the required functions and produce an output supporting the provided selection. 
Try & Except to anticipate known errors.

#### extensions needed:
python
python debugger
markdown checkboxes
markdown emoji


### Program:
p
```python def used for selections 
def addTask():
    new_task = input("add task: ")
    allTasks.append(new_task)
    print(new_task + " has been added\n", [allTasks], end="")

def viewTasks():
    for i in allTasks:
        print("Your list contains: \n", [allTasks])
        continue

def markComplete():
    completedTask = input("Which task is completed?: ")
    updatedTasks = allTasks.remove(completedTask)
    print("Congratulations, " + completedTask + " has been marked completed! \n Your remaining tasks are ",  updatedTasks)
    

def deleteTask():
    removeTask = input("Which task would you like to delete?: " )
    print("The task has been removed \n", [allTasks], allTasks.remove(removeTask))
    

def quitTask():
    quit

def incomplete():
    quit
```
